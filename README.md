# Rides history

Catalog of my group of friend's bicycle rides. Every ride has a data set consisting of members, statistics, photos and map with track.

## Functionality

- List of rides that can be sorted by several parameters and filtered by members
- List separators and key parameters at the right side of list items are different for every type of sorting
- Ride's info section shows members, statistics, link to Strava, gallery with clickable photos
- For each ride there is map with track implemented with Yandex Maps constructor
- Mobile version has completely different layout adapted for small screen

## Used stack

- React (react-router-dom, CSS-modules, react-swipeable for mobile version)
- SCSS (nesting, variables)
- Yandex Maps constructor
